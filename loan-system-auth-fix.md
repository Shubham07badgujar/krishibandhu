# Loan System Authentication Fix - Summary

## Problem
The admin panel was experiencing 401 Unauthorized errors when trying to fetch loan data. The error occurred because the API calls in the `loanService.js` file were looking for the authentication token directly in `localStorage.getItem('token')`, but the token was actually stored inside the user object at `localStorage.getItem('user')`.

## Root Causes
1. Inconsistent token storage and retrieval across the application
2. The loan service was using a direct access pattern (`localStorage.getItem('token')`) while the auth context was storing the token inside a user object (`localStorage.getItem('user')`)

## Implemented Fixes

1. **Fixed token retrieval in loanService.js functions:**
   - Updated `getAllLoans` to correctly extract the token from the user object
   - Updated `getUserLoans` to use the proper token retrieval approach
   - Updated `submitLoanApplication` to use the proper token retrieval approach
   - Updated `makeLoanPayment` to use the proper token retrieval approach
   - Updated `getLoanById` to use the proper token retrieval approach
   - Updated `updateLoanStatus` to use the proper token retrieval approach

2. **Created a centralized auth utility file:**
   - Created a new file `authUtils.js` with utility functions for consistent token retrieval
   - Added `getAuthToken()` function to standardize token access
   - Added `getCurrentUser()`, `isAuthenticated()`, and `isAdmin()` helper functions

3. **Refactored code for better maintainability:**
   - Updated all loan service functions to use the new `getAuthToken()` utility function
   - This ensures consistent token retrieval across all API calls

## Benefits of the Fix
1. Eliminated 401 Unauthorized errors in the admin loan management panel
2. Improved code consistency with standardized authentication handling
3. Reduced redundancy in token retrieval logic
4. Added helper functions that can be used throughout the application

## Next Steps
1. The same pattern could be applied to other service files in the application
2. Consider adding refresh token functionality for better security
3. Add token expiration checks to prevent using expired tokens
