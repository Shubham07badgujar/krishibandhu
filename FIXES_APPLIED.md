# 🔧 KrishiBandhu E-Commerce - Issues Fixed

## ✅ Problems Identified and Resolved:

### 1. **Missing Dependencies**
- ❌ **Issue**: `react-hot-toast`, `@heroicons/react`, and `axios` were not installed
- ✅ **Fixed**: Updated `package.json` with missing dependencies:
  ```json
  "@heroicons/react": "^2.0.18",
  "axios": "^1.6.0", 
  "react-hot-toast": "^2.4.1"
  ```

### 2. **Missing Backend Order Routes**
- ❌ **Issue**: Frontend was calling order APIs that didn't exist
- ✅ **Fixed**: Added complete order management to backend:
  - `POST /api/ecommerce/orders` - Create order
  - `GET /api/ecommerce/orders` - Get user orders
  - `GET /api/ecommerce/orders/:id` - Get order by ID
  - `PUT /api/ecommerce/orders/:id/status` - Update order status

### 3. **Missing Order Controller Functions**
- ❌ **Issue**: Order routes imported non-existent functions
- ✅ **Fixed**: Added complete order controller functions:
  - `createOrder` - Handle order creation with stock validation
  - `getOrders` - Fetch user orders with pagination
  - `getOrderById` - Get specific order details
  - `updateOrderStatus` - Allow sellers to update order status

### 4. **Missing Toast Notifications Setup**
- ❌ **Issue**: Components used `react-hot-toast` but no Toaster was configured
- ✅ **Fixed**: Added Toaster component to App.jsx with proper styling
